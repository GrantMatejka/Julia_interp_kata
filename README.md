# PL430_FinalProject
Repo for my final program in CSC 430 Programming Languages

## Language: Julia

[Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)

## Proposal

Implement an interpreter for a language with some basic types and local variable bindings.
Local variable bindings are going to be handled by closures.

The key of this assignment is not to accomplish this task, but rather to explore a new language in the pursuit of said task, with a 5 hour time limit.


## Timeline

I have 5 hours to do this. This is how they went

1 hour in: Incorporated Primary Operators, not clean at all, but just trying to be fast
           Julia does seem really promising so far and easy transition over
           
+45 min: Fought with julia for a bit about nesting match statements but decided on another approach

+30 min: Created and pretty much finished presentation

+1 hour: Added in support for closure and lambdas

+30 min: Some more random work

+1.5 hour: Tried to get some parsing in but couldn't get much in, also finished presentation
