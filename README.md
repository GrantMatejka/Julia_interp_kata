# PL430_FinalProject
Repo for my final program in CSC 430 Programming Languages

## Language: Julia

[Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)

## Presentation

## Proposal

Implement an interpreter for a language with some basic types and local variable bindings.
Local variable bindings are going to be handled by closures.

The key of this assignment is not to accomplish this task, but rather to explore a new language in the pursuit of said task, with a 5 hour time limit.
